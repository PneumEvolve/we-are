  <h1>We Are</h1>
  <p><strong>A movement, a platform, a vow.</strong></p>

  <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
  <p>We Are is a global, open-source initiative to create a new world where each person’s voice, dream, and value is heard—and integrated. We believe the collective future can only be built when individuals are seen, systems are transparent, and wisdom is shared.</p>

  <h2>The First Step: The Self Node</h2>
  <p>Stage One begins with the <strong>Self Node</strong>: a personal portal where users reflect on their vision for the world, their core values, and what kind of future they want to build. With the help of AI as an unbiased mirror, individuals begin to clarify who they are—and how they fit into the collective whole.</p>

  <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open source</strong> — fully transparent and forkable.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad-free and free forever</strong> — we serve the people, not the profit model.</li>
    <li><strong>AI with ethics</strong> — designed to mirror, not manipulate.</li>
    <li><strong>Security first</strong> — we will protect users from bots, abuse, and surveillance.</li>
    <li><strong>Human-centered</strong> — the platform evolves with real user input.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Vow</h2>
  <blockquote>
    I vow to build a world for all people equally. Should I ever lose sight of that, I will resign from my position immediately.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Vision for the Future</h2>
  <p>As the platform evolves, We Are will enable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Dream Map</strong>: a live collective visualization of what people want.</li>
    <li><strong>Polyvoice Arena</strong>: structured, respectful dialogue and feedback loops.</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesis Engine</strong>: AI-generated shared blueprints based on collective dreams.</li>
    <li><strong>Local + global decision-making</strong> tools powered by informed, value-driven interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Community-driven economy</strong>: secure, peer-to-peer trade and skill/resource exchange.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Join Us</h2>
  <p>This is just the beginning. If you resonate with this vision, follow the build, contribute on GitHub, or simply start your journey through your Self Node. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.</p>

  <p><em>This project is maintained by Shea and Lyra, for the future of humanity.</em></p>
